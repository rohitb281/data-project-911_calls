# 🚨 911 Calls Data Analysis — EDA Capstone Project

A data analysis capstone project that explores real 911 emergency call records using Python. The project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to uncover temporal, geographic, and categorical patterns in emergency incidents.

The notebook demonstrates practical data wrangling, feature engineering, and time-based analysis.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes a 911 calls dataset to identify patterns in emergency requests across time, location, and incident type. The analysis includes feature extraction from timestamps, categorical breakdowns, and trend visualization.

The goal is to transform raw emergency call logs into meaningful insights using structured EDA.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze emergency call data to discover:

- Most common call reasons
- Geographic distribution of incidents
- Hourly, daily, and monthly trends
- Peak emergency periods
- Category-based patterns
